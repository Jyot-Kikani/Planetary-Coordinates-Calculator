# Planetary Coordinates Calculator

## Overview
The **Planetary Coordinates Calculator** is a sophisticated tool designed to compute the coordinates of various celestial bodies in our solar system. This application is ideal for astronomers, astrophysicists, and space enthusiasts who need precise positional data.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Calculations**: Calculate coordinates for any of the 8 planets.
- **Multiple Coordinate Systems**: Support for equatorial, ecliptic, and other coordinate systems.
- **Date Range Support**: Coordinates can be computed for any specified date between 1900 and 2100.

## Functionality
The core functionality of the Planetary Coordinates Calculator includes:
- **Data Input**: Users can input the name of the celestial body and the desired coordinate system.
- **Coordinate Computation**: The application computes the precise coordinates based on the input data.

## Future Enhancements
Planned features for future releases include:
- **Expanded Database**: Inclusion of more celestial bodies and minor planets.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Enhanced graphical representations with 3D models.
- **Custom Coordinate Systems**: Allow users to define and use custom coordinate systems.
